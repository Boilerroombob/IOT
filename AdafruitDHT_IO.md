IOT-Outdoor-Thermometer
This is based on Adafruit IO project, "https://learn.adafruit.com/home-automation-in-the-cloud-with-the-esp8266-and-adafruit-io" which after much Googling resulted in a few modifications.

Mod #1 "https://learn.adafruit.com/home-automation-in-the-cloud-with-the-esp8266-and-adafruit-io" this correct a change to MQTT that wasn't reflected in the original project pages.

Mod #2 "http://community.blynk.cc/t/2147483647-value-intermittend-dht11-nodemcu-and-blynk/8259" and "https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Goto" This helped control random bad data from skewing feed info on Adafruit IO.
